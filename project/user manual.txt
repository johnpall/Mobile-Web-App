This mobile-friendly web application enables clients to store contact
details such as Name(First Name and Last Name), Email Address, and Phone Number.
It allows contacts to be Created, Read, Updated, Deleted, and Edited.

When deleting a contact from the mobile-friendly web application, there is 
a prompt that pops up to make sure that the action is confirmed and not a mistake 
by the user.
